1- 
a. Apply the U(1) symmetry arising from the conservation of $S_{z,tot}$ to the Heisenberg models with $J_1=1$ and $J_2=0.3$.
b. Obtain and plot the energy spectrum of the system (20 lowest energies) for a one-dimensional periodic chain of length 16 at $S_{z,tot}=0$.
c. Plot the spin-spin correlation function.
d. Calculate and plot the entropy in the entanglement of $ n $ spins on the left with the spins on the right, for $n=1,2,...,16$.

2- Repeat the above problem for a two-dimensional system with dimensions 4 by 4 (total of 16 spins).

3- 
a. Consider a one-dimensional Heisenberg model where the nearest-neighbor interaction ($J_1=1$) alternates between 1 and 0, only existing between sites 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, etc. (interaction between sites 2 and 3, 4 and 5, etc., is zero). In this question, $J_2$ will be zero throughout. Obtain the ground state of this interaction both analytically and numerically.
b. Now, assume that at times $t>0$, interactions between all nearest neighbors (with periodicity condition) are established with a strength of $J_1=1$ (conventional one-dimensional Heisenberg model). Obtain the state evolution from part a up to $t = 10$ (where you can take $\hbar = 1$ and $\delta_t = 0.05$ everywhere), and calculate and plot the following correlation functions for any desired $t$ (within the specified time interval):

   - $<S_i(t)S_j(t)>$
   - $<S_i(t)S_j(0)>$
   - $<EE(x=L/2,t)>$
